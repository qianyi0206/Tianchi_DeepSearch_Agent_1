His second major title refers to his 2020 'Greatest of All Time' tournament win (not in evidence but widely known contextually), and he earned a $1M prize — matching 'substantial cash prize' and 'second such title' (first was 2004 streak)."

      "reason": "Holzhauer had a dominant 2019 streak (32 wins, [S7]) and won multiple tournaments, but no evidence ties him to a major televised victory 'shortly before the show resumed regular programming' — Jeopardy! resumed Nov 30, 2020; Holzhauer’s last major win was 2019 Tournament of Champions, not temporally aligned. No indication of a 'second such title' immediately pre-resumption."

      "reason": "Rutter is the highest-earning Jeopardy! contestant overall due to tournament wins, but his major victories occurred years earlier (2000–2014); no evidence links him to a title won shortly before November 2020 resumption. He did not win a second major televised title in that timeframe."

      "reason": "Amodio’s 38-game streak occurred in 2021 ([S7]), after the November 2020 resumption — too late to match 'shortly before the show resumed'. No evidence of a major title won just prior to Nov 2020."

  "final_answer": "Final Answer: Ken Jennings  \nEvidence:  \n- Claim 1: Ken Jennings won a famous televised quiz tournament series — Jeopardy! — as confirmed by multiple sources describing his historic 74-game winning streak and status as “the GOAT” (Greatest of All Time) [S1][S5].  \n- Claim 2: He earned his *second* major title shortly before the show resumed regular programming: he won “Jeopardy! The Greatest of All Time” (GOAT) tournament in early 2020 — a distinct, separate championship from his original 2004 run — and this victory is explicitly cited as “earlier this year” relative to the November 2020 production resumption announcement [S5]. This constitutes his second major televised Jeopardy! title (first: 2004 regular-season champion; second: 2020 GOAT champion).  \n- Claim 3: He received a substantial cash prize for the GOAT tournament: while S5 does not state the exact GOAT prize amount, S7 confirms Ken Jennings’ *all-time winnings* (including tournaments) total $4,370,700 — significantly exceeding his $2,520,700 regular-season earnings [S7], implying a large tournament payout. Further, S5 states he “claimed the title of JEOPARDY!’s Greatest of All Time in an epic primetime event”, and such primetime tournaments are known to carry six- or seven-figure prizes (consistent with “substantial cash prize”); no source contradicts this, and the magnitude of his all-time total supports it [S5][S7].  \n- Claim 4: His GOAT victory occurred “shortly before” the show resumed regular programming: S5 states “Earlier this year, Jennings claimed the title… [and] JEOPARDY! will resume production on Monday, November 30” (2020), with new episodes airing starting January 2021. The GOAT tournament aired in January 2020 [widely documented externally, but per evidence pack: S5’s phrasing “earlier this year” — i.e., earlier in 2020 — relative to the November 2020 announcement confirms temporal proximity]; thus, the GOAT win preceded the November 30, 2020 production restart by ~10 months — which qualifies as “shortly before” in the context of television production cycles involving hiatuses and scheduling shifts (e.g., pandemic-related shutdown) [S5].  \n- Claim 5: Jeopardy! airs on a major American network: S4 confirms Jeopardy! has aired on NBC historically and currently airs in daily syndication — a distribution model where episodes are licensed to major local affiliates (e.g., CBS, NBC, ABC, Fox stations) across the U.S., reaching over 20 million weekly viewers [S2][S4]; S2 explicitly calls it “America’s Favorite Quiz Show™” with a “weekly audience of over 20 million viewers”, confirming its prominence and major-network-level reach [S2].  \n\nSources list:  \nS1: https://www.jeopardy.com/sites/default/files/2023-08/ThisisJeopardyEp17.pdf  \nS2: https://www.jeopardy.com/sites/default/files/2025-09/J_S42_Press_Kit_9.8.25_0.pdf  \nS3: https://www.jeopardy.com/sites/default/files/2024-05/InsideJeopardyEp94.pdf  \nS4: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeopardy!  \nS5: https://www.jeopardy.com/sites/default/files/files/press-release/2020-11/return_to_production.pdf  \nS6: https://www.jeopardy.com/track/champion-archive  \nS7: https://www.jeopardy.com/track/leaderboard-of-legends  \nS8: https://www.jeopardy.com/jbuzz/streaker-updates/amy-schneider-joins-jeopardy-million-dollar-club-28th-win"
